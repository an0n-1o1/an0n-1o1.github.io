    <p>Activity 1:
    Sending and Replying to an Email.
    For this activity, I simply have to send an email, and reply to an email I recieved.
    I have sent emails before, so this activity is easy for me, it was even easier using Gmail, as while I typed my email, Google autocorrected words I misspelled, as well as auto-complete certain sentences. Replying to an Email was easy as well, with it being very similar to sending an email.
    I already know how to email, but this activity helped me with writing more formal emails, so when I have to write an email in the future, I can sound more professional.
    Activity 2:
    Using internet mailing lists.
    For this activity, I searched up different internet mailing lists, as well as discovering bulk email restrictions.
    I don't consider signing up for a mailing list, as I feel that would clog up my inbox with spam and junkmail. Mailing lists are usually used for major businesses, as these lists are used for data analysis. One mailing list I found was called MailingLists.com, this site said it was a mailing list for mailing lists, as it describes itself as the "expert guide to more than 75,000 postal, telemarketing, and email lists currently available." Bulk email services don't interest me either, but I searched them up anyway, with SendGrid catching my eye. SendGrid says that it could "handle my important emails," as it sends over 130 billion emails per month.
    Although I'm not interested for signing up for any lists, these listing sites could help in the future via showing me jobs I may be interested in.</p>
