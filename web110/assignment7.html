    <p>Activity 1:
    Readings  
    For this activity, I read about reference models, protocols, and the domain name system.
    The readings were very interesting, I learned about two different reference models, the OSI model and the TCP model, I don't know which one we use mainly, but I think it's the TSP model due to how the other readings mention the TSP model as well. I was suprised to learn that Internet Protocal, or IP, is totally dependent on TCP, I see IP mentioned a bunch of times in media, but never TCP.
    Although the readings taught me some things I've previously learned before, It was a great refresher, as well as it was being helpful with learning about this assignment's subject.
    Activity 2:
    Reasearching plans
    For this activity, I reasearch different plans of different cable and wireless companies.
    I see tons of cell phone provider ads on TV, and a lot of them say mainly the same thing: "we can give you a super fast internet connection, as well as a free phone if you sign up now!", and I wanted to see if that was actually true, so I went onto AT&T's website, as well as T-Mobile's website, and compared the two. I have noticed that T-Mobile relies more on coverage, advertising that it provides unlimited 5G for all plans, while AT&T advertises more about it's unlimited talk and text.
    Researching about different plans for celluar service is very helpful for me, because once I move out on my own, I'll have to get a service of my own, and reasearching them early could help me settle descisions early as well.</p>
