    <p>Activity 1:
    Practicing web browser safety.
    For this activity, I went into my Google account, and selected my privacy. To be more specific, I went into my settings and checked my privacy.
    The first thing I did when I went into my privacy settings was that I did a safety check, which saves me time from checking everything manually, and I was up to date on my browser, but I had two passwords that were considered weak. I had also cleared my cache, I know how to clear my cache, since I usually do this on my phone. The most interesting thing about my settings that it had a "privacy guide", it was a simple basic guide about what privacy settings are enabled, and it told me what each setting meant, and what it did.
    I didn't even know that I had two weak passwords, and thanks to this activity, I do now, and I'll probably change them soon. I'll make sure to go to my privacy settings every now and then, so I can make sure I am secured on the internet.
    Activity 2:
    Using a anti-malware software.
    For this activity, I used an anti-malware software to check my computer for any malware.
    When I got the computer I am using, my dad went to Best Buy to get an security program called Webroot installed on my computer, and occaisionally, Webroot would run a background check on my computer, to see if there's any unimportant files, malware, and other things. It has been very helpful for me, I used it today to scan for any malware, and it came back saying no malware has been dectected, which is good. Webroot also has it's uses outside of scanning, as checks websites as well, so when I google something, and there's a link to a website, webroot would scan the site, and indicate if it was a safe or not.
    If I ever have to get a new computer, I'll make sure I get an anti-malware service installed rightaway, so I can be safe when browsing the internet.</p>
