    <h1> Assignment 10: CSS </h1>
    <p>For today's class, I learned about CSS, and how to customize my webpage with all sorts of things, like colors, fonts, borders, and so much more. at first, it sounded confusing to me, there were a lot of words that didn't click to me, and I got confused about what to specifically copy and paste, but my teacher helped me out with what I needed to type for my style.css file, and once I got the hang of that, it was smooth sailing from there! Using CSS could help me show off my personality more, as I can color and customize my webpages to look less boring.</p>
