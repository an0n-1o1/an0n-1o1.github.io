    <h1> Assignment 12: Web accessibility </h1>
   
    <p><strong> Activity 1: </strong>
    
    For this acitvity, I have read Mozilla's article about web acessibilty, and what it is. The article not only talks about what acessibility is in general, but it also shows what disabilities one might have, and how to make one's website accessible to users with said disabilities, and it's not just hearing and visual disabilities, but also cognitive disabilities, like dyslexia, and movement disabilities aare mentioned as well. With more knowledge about what disabilities one might have, I can use this article to reference how to work around these, and make my website more accessible to others.
      <strong> Activity 2: </strong>
    
    For this activity, I went to the website Palleton to check if the colors I have selected for my style are color-blind friendly. There were many kinds and types of color blindness, so I checked my background color and my heading text color. my background color to someone with tritanopia makes it look more green, while my heading color to someone with protanopia makes it look yellow, I have noticed that my background color is the most unchanged color for people with color blindness, while my heading text color is the most changed for people with color blindness. Its very interesting to see how colors can look from people with certain types of color blindness, and with knowing this, I can check how my website could look to someone with a certain type of color blindness, and if I need to change a certain color in order to make it easier for people with that type of color blindness easier to navigate and see my website better.</p>
