    <h1> Assignment 16: IT Careers</h1>
    <p>For this assignment, we learned about careers, and how to find the career that we seek. for the first activity, I read some tutorials about how to plan out my future career, as well as another tutorial about how to search for jobs. I do know what career I want to have in the future, which is to be a character designer, and I have done some job searching about my career in some of my highschool classes, but it was nice to get a refresher about how to do a proper job search. this activity will prepare me for when I have to search for the job I want in the career I seek. The second activity had me read a tutorial about resumes, and why they are important for finding a job. I know some basics about what resumes are, as resumes are papers that lists off a persons background and education, to persuade somebody into hiring said person for their job, but I was suprised to know that there are multiple types of resumes, and while these types are very similar, they are different in the way they are typed out. for example, the chronological resume lists out jobs that the person previously had first, while the functional resume groups applicable skills together. learning about how resumes are helpful, and what types of resumes there are, can help me in the future, so that if I ever have to create a resume, I'll know which type of resume would help me the most in getting a job. </p>
