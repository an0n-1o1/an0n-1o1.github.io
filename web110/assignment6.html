    <p>Activity 1:
    Reading about Internet services.
    For this activity, I went onto the website TutorialPoint and read about Internet services. When I read the article, I learned about Communication services, Informational retrieval services, the World Wide Web, and Web services. I learned that Mailing lists, the thing that we learned from Assignment 4, is a Communication service! I also learned that services like Skype and Zoom are Communication services as well, meaning that not all services are just texting.
    Reading about Interent service can help me in the future because now I understand that there is much more about communicating on the computer than I originally thought.
    Activity 2:
    Reading about Intellectual property.
    In this activity, I read about piracy, or should I say, I read more stuff about piracy, as I have already heard about piracy and what it means. what I found interesting about the article I read was that it was mainly about piracy of music, which I guess make since because sometimes, a song one might be looking for might not be available on any music streaming service. When most people think about piracy, they mainly think about downloading music without paying, but piracy isn't just about music, there's also the pirating of movies, as there are tons and tons of free movie streaming websites like 123Movies that are designed to pirate movies.
    Reading about piracy taught me more about the subject, as well as teaching me the consequences about pirating. I can use this information in the future, so I can see whether or not something that has been downloaded or shared with me was actually legal or not.
