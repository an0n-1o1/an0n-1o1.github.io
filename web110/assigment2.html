    <p>Exersise 1
    Reading about web browsers and internet tips
      Learn definitions and learn about the internet
      Although I know some definitions, this will help me familiarize with the defintions and meanings even more, I even learned new ones I didn't know in the first place!
   .
      Exersise 2
      Installing a browser
      Install a web browser, there are many to choose from
    I have installed a browser called "Brave", it is very interesting. First, it already comes with some ad blockers, so that will be helpful for me in the future when I need to read articles or watch videoes.
    Brave can be very helpful with me in case something isn't available on chrome, or chrome is not working for some reason.
