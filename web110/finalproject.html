    <h1>Final Project for Internet fundementals</h1>
    <p>The Internet fundementals class I took was very useful to me. When I had to take this class in the begining, I thought that this wouldn't really help me, but now, I can see how learning how to make your own website, as well as learning about how the internet works, is really helpful for several things. For what topic to go over for my final project, I chose CSS, because I think creativity and looks should be one of the top priorities for making a website. I really had fun in this class, and I hope you liked me too.</p>
