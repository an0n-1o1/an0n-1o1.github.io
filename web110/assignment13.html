    <p> for this assignment, we learned about databases, and we also learned about SQL. There were five activities in total, but they were really short, so I'll classify them as one whole activity. At first I thought this assignment was going to be hard due to how we needed to use the unordered list code, and that made me get slightly flustered, but once I started the activity, it was way easier than I thought it was, because all we had to do was to copy and paste the SQL codes into github, and they didn't even need to work! I don't know if I'll need to use this specific type of code in the future, due to my type of job, but I think it'll be helpful for me when I need to create a database for something! </p>
