    <p>Activity 1:
    Comparing search engines.
    I Tested out different kinds of search engines, and see which one I perfer. Then, after choosing a Search engine I like, I searched up the market share of Search engines.
    I searched up the same thing for each Search engine I used, which was the term 'Web Search engines', Google suggested me websites that listed other great search engines to use other than Google, Yahoo's first suggested website was a LifeWire article listing of the best search engines, altough the LifeWire article was from last year, Bing suggested both Yahoo and Google for its first suggestions, and Ask's first suggestion, which came after five Ad links, thought I was searching for scholarships. Needless to say, I chose to stick with Google, after all, when I looked up the market share, Google had the most percentage on StatCounter, with a whopping 92%.
    This activity helped me get to know different kinds of search engines, and how they differ from one another. This is useful to me because sometimes, when searching for something specific, one engine could show me what I exactly need, where other search engines do not.  
    Activity 2:
    Using Internet Archive.
    I used Interent Archive, or Wayback Machine, as some people know it, to look at how certain websites looked in the past. Then I saved a URL to Internet Archive so it can be used as a citation for the future.
    The website I chose to use on the Wayback Machine was Newgrounds, an entertainment website. I typed in the Websites URL, and Wayback Machine showed me different snapshots to choose from, the snapshot I chose was from December 10th, 2013. Newgrounds looked very different from what it looks like now, as it sports a more rugged look rather than its sleek look it has today, the website layout didn't change though, and I'm glad to know that the site is still going strong today. I then decided to a URL to Wayback Machine, and it was very simple, as I simply typed in a URL and clicked on Save.
    Wayback Machine is very useful to me, as it can show me websites that have been previously shutdown, so I can look at articles that are now unaccessable.</p>
