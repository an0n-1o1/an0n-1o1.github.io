    <p>Activity 1:
    Creating a LinkedIn Profile
    For this activity, I created a Profile for the website LinkedIn
    Setting up a LinkedIn profile was easy because it let me use my Google account to Sign up. I also wanted to get a LinkedIn account so that it could help me find jobs in the future. Nonetheless, the LinkedIn account was very easy to set up and customize.
    Having a LinkedIn account could help me find jobs in the future, it also helps that my LinkedIn profile is more serious, so that I look more professional for people who want to hire me in the future.
    Activity 2:
    Find Social Media sites that interest me
    TutorialPoint listed some social media sites that are widely used, some I have heard of, and some that I have not, one of which seems interesting to me. the website that interested me the most was Hike, I have never heard of it before and I decided I wanted to check it out, and it turns ou that Hike is a mobile messaging app, like Whatsapp or Discord. as I looked into Hike, however, I lost interest because it's the same as all the other messaging sites and apps I have encounterd over the years.
    Nonetheless, this helped me find more social media sites to possibly sign up for, and help me get in contact with future friends, coworkers, or even future relationships.</p>
