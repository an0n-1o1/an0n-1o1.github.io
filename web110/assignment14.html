    <h1>Assigment 14: Project Management</h1>
    <p>For this assigment, we learned the ins and outs of project management, and we also made Gantt charts for our final presentations. Learning about project management was interesting, since I also have a class in Intro to Graphic arts technology, and that class does mention project management as well. We worked in Microsoft Xcel to make our Gantt Charts, albeit I had to use Microsoft Home in order to actually edit my Gantt chart. I am actually a tiny bit worried about my time management, as I have an 8-page essay for English 102 due on the same day as the final submisson for the presitation is due, and I have a bad habit of focusing on one project instead of multitasking, but maybe with my Gantt Chart, I can use it to schedule out my time more specifically. on the positive side, I tend to get a lot of work done quickly in a few hours, so maybe I end up completeing my presitation faster than I have originally thought! </p>
