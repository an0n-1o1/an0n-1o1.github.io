    <h1> Assignment 9: HTML </h1>
    <p><strong> What I learned today:</strong>
    
    Today, I have learned about HTML, and I went through many trial and errors. For the assignment, I had to make an anchor tag for my main index page in order so it can link to my assignments, and it was very hard, sure, I did use some copy and pasting for it, but I forgot something in the base, so I didn't have the complete code, and when the link didn't work, I started panicking. Luckily, my teacher helped me find out what was wrong with it, and it turns out I forgot the end tag, so I kinda panicked over nothing, I felt like a clown. However, making the web 110 index was easier, and I even solved my own error! This Assignment was actually fun, I thought it was going to be harder for me since my class is doing assigments differently now that were learning about HTML, but it turns out it's way more fun and easier! I can use this knowledge in the future if I ever have to promote myself in order to help me get a job in my career.</p>
