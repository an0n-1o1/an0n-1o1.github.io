    <h1> Assignment 11 </h1>
    <p>For this assignment, I had to insert an Image, audio, and youtube hyperlink into HTML / CSS, and I think this was my hardest assignment yet. The hardest part for me was learning how put images and audio files into github using visual studio code, due to how complicated the process was. Luckily, my teacher was there to help me through the process, and I started to understand it more. Inserting the Embed Youtube link was the easiet part of the assignment, due to how I just had to copy and paste the embed link. Since I am going into charactr design, this assignment and lesson will help me a lot, so when I have to make a personal website, and I have to show examples of my work, I can use this lesson as a refresher on how to insert images if I ever forget.</p>
